# Preliminary Experiments!
## TL;DR
Experiments that looked at some assay parameters. The tests revealed a problem with light scattering hat may obscure some important data, which is probably because the protein is precipitating because of some interaction with the plastic assay plate.

### Aim of the experiments
These experiments are to make a version of a classical P450 binding tiration in a plate. Classical titrations iteratively add test compounds to a cuvette, mix and then record the changes in the UV-Vis absorbance profile. Changes at 390 and 420 nm are used to calculate the dissosciation constant, $$K_d$$
