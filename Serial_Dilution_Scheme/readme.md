## Seial Dilution Scheme
### TL;DR
I want to dispense my compounds using serial dilutions because thy're easy. Here's how.

### Background
* The [last set of tests](P450_Assay_Development/PlateSelection/) showed that plate type probably doesn't matter, they all looked similar
* The plastic of the plate might be absorbing some of the short wave light, I'll try to confirm that in this test
* In the 2018 tests, I had trouble mixing fatty acids dispensed by Echo with the assay mix, I think I'll have more luck with a serial dilution

### Plan
Here's what I want to keep fixed and why:
* ```[Protein]``` at 10 uM - Gives a good signal to noise ratio, not far off what we'd use for a classical titration
* ```Volume of DMSO in each well```
