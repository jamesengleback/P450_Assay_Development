# P450_Assay_Development

[Work from 2018](2018_Data/readme.md) where I did a battery of experiments to try to minimise the standard deviation of this assay.

[Plate selection](PlateSelection/20190531_PlateTypeSelection.md) - Back again after almost a year!The [work from 2018](2018_Data/readme.md) showd that the protein is probably precipitating on contact with the plate walls, so I'm testing a few different plates for that.
