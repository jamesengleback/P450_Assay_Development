# P450_Assay_Development

### Contents
[Work from 2018](2018_Data/readme.md) where I did a battery of experiments to try to minimise the standard deviation of this assay. This all showed two big problems: absorbance/scattering at short wavelengths which may interfere with measurements and lack of mixing of non--polar compounds (fatty acids) after being dispensed by the Echo.

1. [Plate selection](PlateSelection/20190531_PlateTypeSelection.md) - Which Plate scatters short wavelengths least? (they all do)
2. [Serial Dilution scheme](P450_Assay_Development/Serial_Dilution_Scheme) - Can I get the compounds in solution? Does the 'scattering' even matter?
